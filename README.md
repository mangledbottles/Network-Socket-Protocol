# UDP Network Socket Protocol

![UDP Diagram](./Misc/Diagram.png)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mangledbottles/Network-Socket-Protocol.git
cd Network-Socket-Protocol
npm i
```
## Usage

### Server
There can only be one server
```
npm run server
```

### Dockerizing Server
Build an image from a Dockerfile and run in a new container
```docker
docker build .
docker run -i -p 8080:8080/udp [IMAGE_ID]
```
- -i parameter allows the user to **work with IO inside the Docker container** for Server Broadcasting
- -p parameter exposes the port 8080 for UDP use (see [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile))
- [IMAGE_ID] is the build ID that is run in the second command

### Client
There can be many clients
```
npm run client
```
> ![StartClient](./Misc/StartClient.png)
> Starting the Client sends a message to the Server and the Server response with the current time

# Topology
## Dockerfile
This project has been [dockerized](./Dockerfile)
> ![Dockerfile](./Misc/Dockerfile.png)

## Server.ts
The Server.ts file contains 4 main functionalities
1. Create UDP server with the dgram library
2. Read user IO from the CLI
3. Listen to incomining messages from Clients
4. Send messages to Client(s)

## Broadcasting
The Server can send a message to all Clients. The user types into the CLI and the Server manages the IO and broadcasts the message to all connected Clients. To broadcast a message to all Clients, run the Docker container ([as seen above](#dockerizing-server)), then type a message into the CLI and press enter.
> ![ServerBroadcastToClients](./Misc/ServerBroadcastToClients.png)
> When a Client connects to the Server, their address and port are saved. When a broadcast is called, the message is sent to all addresses and ports connected. An Typescript interface has been created for Client and all Client's are stored in a Set to prevent duplicates.

## Client.ts
The Client.ts file connects to the Server, sends a message to the Server and listens for messages from the Server.

## Wireshark
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a network packet analyzer.

This is one request taken from the PCAP file which intercepted a message from the Server to the Client sending the current date. The payload is send in hexadecimal format. In the Info tab, you can see the request is being sent from port 8080 (Server) to port 60137 (generated port for given Client).
